Once upon a time in a forest, 
there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree, 
which was on the banks of a river. In the same forest, 
there lived a crocdile and his wife......
One day, the crocdile came to the banks of the river 
and rested under the tree, the kind hearted monkey offered him
some fruits, crocodile came back the next day for some more fruits,
as he loved them. As days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey 
became good friends.
